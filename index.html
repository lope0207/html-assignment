        <h2> About Me </h2>
        <p> Hello! My name is <strong>Santiago,</strong> I was born in December 18<sup>th</sup> <em>in Medellin, Colombia</em> also known as <q> The city of the eternal spring.</q>
        I am <em> 25 years old,</em> and I just finished my career in my home country as an <strong> Industrial Designer </strong> or <abbr>ID.</abbr> 
        Now, since I am done with my major in Colombia, i decided to come to Canada to continue my studies, getting more and more knowledge about everything related to <strong>DESIGN</strong>, </p>
        <p>A list of hobbies that I really enjoy to do on my free time are: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Play videogames with friends.</li>
            <li>Drawing.</li>
            <li>Watch movies or TV shows.</li>
            <li>Learn about design.</li>
          </ul>
        <p> What else can I say about me? I am married, I have a dog in Colombia, his name is <em> MAX, </em> is a siberian husky; and here in Canada, me and my wife brought a little cat named <em>IRIS.</em>
            About personal hobbies I really like to draw, that was one of the reasons why I decided to study <abbr>ID</abbr>, and other thing that I really enjoy to do during my free time is play some videogames with friends.
